# Beyond API
Beyond API is a service designed to facilitate the use of BISINDO sign language translation applications. By providing an image as input, the API processes the image and returns the corresponding letter as output. It provides endpoints for GET and POST.

The documentation for the endpoints as well as example responses can be found at https://documenter.getpostman.com/view/34770773/2sA3XQh2jR
